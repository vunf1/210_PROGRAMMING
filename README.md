# C++ :sunny: 210 COURSEWORK :four_leaf_clover:
### Manual c++ -> https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp 

### If same functions on the program dont work you need to give full permission to the files/folder

__"sudo chmod -R 755"__

### BUGS FOUND

bug after trying to insert in the matrix - random memory leaks 

---


### Development "Board"


##### Coursework Backlog

> - [ ] 3 GRAPH - implement a function isPath(v, w) ->(where v and w are vertices in the graph to check if there is a path between the two nodes. The path found will be printed to a text file as a sequence of integer numbers (the node values));

> - [ ] 4 GRAPH - implement a function isConnected(G) to check whether or not the graph is strongly connected. The output should be simply 'yes' or 'no';


Adapt the previous graph
> - [ ] 5 GRAPH - Implement BFS;
> - [ ] 5 GRAPH - Implement DFS;
> - [ ] 5 GRAPH - Save the nodes traversed in sequence to a text file;


> - [ ] 6 GRAPH - structure to support weighted connections and implement Dijkstra’s algorithm.

##### Coursework On-Board

> - [ ] GRAPH - USER INPUT HANDLE ('False');

> - [ ] 2 BST -  function delete_node;

---


##### Coursework Finish/Release

> - [x] 1 BST - from a suitable file format, such as .txt.;
> - [x] 1 BST - function bin_tree_find;
> - [x] 1 BST - extract words insert on tree;
> - [x] 1 BST - Printing the tree in in-order;
> - [x] 1 BST - function frequency of words;
> - [x] 1 BST - output the path traversed ;

---

> - [x] 3 GRAPH - ask how many vertices, handle the input  2d matrix;
