# C++ :sunny: 210 COURSEWORK :four_leaf_clover:
### Manual c++ -> https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp 

### If same functions on the program dont work you need to give full permission to the files/folder

__"sudo chmod -R 755"__

### BUGS FOUND

---

### Development "Board"


##### Coursework Backlog




##### Coursework On-Board

> - [ ] 3 GRAPH - implement a function isPath(v, w) ->(where v and w are vertices in the graph to check if there is a path between the two nodes. The path found will be printed to a text file as a sequence of integer numbers (the node values));

> - [x] 4 GRAPH - implement a function isConnected(G) to check whether or not the graph is strongly connected. The output should be simply 'yes' or 'no';


Adapt the previous graph

> - [ ] GRAPH - Dijkstra's Algorithm ;
---


##### Coursework Finish/Release

> - [x] 1 BST - from a suitable file format, such as .txt.;
> - [x] 1 BST - function bin_tree_find;
> - [x] 1 BST - extract words insert on tree;
> - [x] 1 BST - Printing the tree in in-order;
> - [x] 1 BST - function frequency of words;
> - [x] 1 BST - output the path traversed ;
> - [x] 1 BST -  PRE_ORDER ;
> - [x] 2 BST -  function delete_node;

---
> - [x] GRAPH - USER INPUT HANDLE ('False');
> - [x] GRAPH - ask how many vertices, handle the input  2d matrix;
> - [x] GRAPH - addEdge;
> - [x] GRAPH - isConnected (Vertice to Vertice);
> - [x] GRAPH - isConnected (Strongly -> all vertices have a connection);
> - [x] 5 GRAPH - Implement BFS;
> - [x] 5 GRAPH - Implement DFS;
> - [x] 5 GRAPH - Save the nodes traversed in sequence to a text file;
> - [x] GRAPH - path between Vertices;
> - [x] 6 GRAPH - structure to support weighted .

:exclamation: :exclamation: Important for IPP/Viva :computer:
